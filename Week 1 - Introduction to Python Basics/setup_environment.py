print("Python is a high-level programming language that was developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It was designed to prioritize readability and simplicity, making it easier for both beginners and experienced developers to write and maintain code.")

print("""Key Points:
- High-level language: Python abstracts away most of the complex details of the computer, allowing you to focus on writing clear, logical code.
- Guido van Rossum: He created Python while working at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands, and Python's design was influenced by his desire to make programming more accessible.""")

How to Set Up Python:
1. Download Python:
    - Go to the official Python website and download the latest version of Python.
    - Choose the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
    
2. Install Python:
    - On Windows: Run the installer and make sure to check the box "Add Python to PATH". Then click "Install Now".
    - On macOS and Linux: Python usually comes pre-installed. You can check this by typing 'python --version' in the terminal. If not installed, you can install it using the command 'brew install python' (for macOS with Homebrew) or 'sudo apt-get install python3' (for Linux).

3. Verify the Installation:
    - Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).
    - Type 'python --version' or 'python3 --version' and hit enter. If Python is installed correctly, it will show the installed version number.

4. Writing Your First Python Program:
    - Open a text editor, write your Python code, and save it as 'hello.py'.
    - Run it by typing 'python hello.py' in the terminal.
