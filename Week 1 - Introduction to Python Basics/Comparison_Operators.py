"""10 practice program 

Equal Check: Write a program that checks if two numbers provided by the user are equal.

Greater Than or Less Than: Create a program that takes two numbers and determines which one is greater or if they are equal.

Age Comparison: Ask the user for their age and compare it with a specific age (e.g., 18) to check if they are an adult or not.

Password Match: Write a program that asks the user to enter a password twice and checks if both entries match.

Temperature Comparison: Create a program that takes two temperature readings and compares them to determine which one is higher or if they are equal.

Grade Evaluation: Write a program that asks the user for their score and compares it with predefined grade thresholds (e.g., A, B, C) to determine the grade.

Discount Eligibility: Create a program that checks if a userâ€™s total purchase amount qualifies for a discount based on a specific threshold (e.g., $100).

Voting Eligibility: Ask the user for their age and check if they are eligible to vote based on a minimum age requirement (e.g., 18).

Number Range Check: Write a program that checks if a user-provided number is within a specific range (e.g., 1 to 100).

String Comparison: Create a program that compares two strings entered by the user and checks if they are identical, or if one is lexicographically greater than the other."""
